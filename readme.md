Navigate to the root of your project and run npm init -y â€” this will initialize a package.json file for your project. The package.json file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If you fail to initialize a package.json file, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code after cloning your project.
